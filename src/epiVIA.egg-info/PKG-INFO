Description: ## Description of epiVIA
        Vector Integration Analysis with epigenomic assays.
        
        ### (1) Identify Chimeric reads from bam file
        
        EpiVIA parses each read and identifies the chimeric fragments, which are further classified into three different categories based on how the read pair is aligned to the combined reference genome: (1) “pair-chimeric” are the fragments with one read mapped to the host genome and the other mapped to the provirus (or vector) genome; (2) “host-chimeric” are the fragments that both ends mapped to the host genome, with a small soft-clipped fragment at one end which can exactly match the start or end of LTR sequence of provirus; (3) “viral-chimeric” are the fragments that are properly pair mapped to either end of the provirus genome, with a soft-clipped fragment at the end which can be mapped to the host genome with a non-zero mapping quality. Since the real chimeric fragment won’t be soft-clipped at 3’ end of 5’ LTR and 5’ end of 3’ LTR, while these cases can present in the alignment results, we corrected the aligned position for these fragments. 
        
        ### (2) Identify integration site with chimeric reads
        
        Although there is pair rescue during the alignment of BWA, we still found some pair-chimeric fragments which have soft-clipped ends from the other genome. Hence, we intend to identify the integration site with the soft-clipped read. If the read mapped to host genome is a soft-clipped alignment, we can determine the precise integration site if the clipped oligonucleotide exactly match either end of the LTR of provirus. In the other case, if the viral read that is aligned to the end of LTR is soft-clipped, we try to search the clipped fragment in the context of up or down 200 bp where the host read aligned, and an exact match can tell us the precise integration site. For host-chimeric and viral-chimeric fragments, we identify the integration site while classifying these fragments. These integration sites are further annotated with genes, transposable elements and enhancer annotation from UCSC genome browser database.
